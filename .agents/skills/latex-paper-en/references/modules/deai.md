# Module: De-AI Editing

**Trigger**: deai, humanize, reduce AI traces, natural writing, tone cleanup

**Purpose**: Detect likely AI-writing traces in visible prose while preserving LaTeX structure and technical claims.

## Commands

```bash
uv run python -B scripts/deai_check.py main.tex --section introduction
uv run python -B scripts/deai_check.py main.tex --analyze
uv run python -B scripts/deai_batch.py main.tex --all-sections
```

## Raw Script Output

- `deai_check.py` emits section-level analysis, trace scores, and optional fix suggestions.
- `deai_batch.py` supports broader batch inspection across sections.
- The `tense` category (`[Script]` LOW) flags present-tense reporting verbs in Methods / Experiments / Results, gated to those sections; see [tense-guide.md](tense-guide.md).
- The `overclaim` category (`[Script]` LOW) flags unambiguous causal / firstness / universality phrasing; see [over-claim-guard.md](../evidence/over-claim-guard.md).

## Skill-Layer Response

- Treat the script output as analysis, not as permission to rewrite the paper by default.
- Return `% DE-AI ...` style findings or a short risk summary unless the user explicitly asks for source edits.
- Preserve `\cite{}`, `\ref{}`, `\label{}`, custom macros, and math environments.
- Never invent new claims, metrics, baselines, or references while smoothing the prose.

## Claim-Evidence-First Humanization

Before reducing AI tone, preserve the academic payload:

- **Facts/evidence**: numbers, datasets, experiments, figures, tables, citations, equations, and metrics.
- **Claims/stance**: the paper's real contribution, uncertainty, design choice, and limitation.
- **Logic**: paragraph role, section role, and claim-evidence map.
- **Boundaries**: assumptions, scope, missing evidence, and unsupported claims.

Only then remove rhetorical scaffolds such as `not merely A, but B`, `essentially`, `the key is`, `The conclusion is:`, or vague `this/things/factors`. Keep a contrast when it names a real baseline, criterion, and evidence; otherwise state the claim directly. The module should not promise lower detector scores or replace venue AI-use disclosure.

Treat defensive speculative explanations as `[LLM]` findings: when a paragraph stacks
multiple mechanisms and then says the current data verify none of them, map each retained
mechanism to a visible evidence anchor or discriminating test. If no mechanism is supported,
state that it remains undetermined and move testable alternatives to future work. Do not
delete the caveat or strengthen the inference merely to sound decisive.

The script's `hedge` / `hedge_application` suggestions still correctly calibrate
over-confident wording and undemonstrated applications. `results suggest` and
`may / could` reduce claim strength; they do not replace per-mechanism evidence.

## Disclosure obligation (read before de-AI editing)

This module improves readability; it does **not** remove a disclosure obligation.
If an LLM had a non-trivial role in producing the paper, the target venue may
require you to disclose it (in a dedicated section, a checklist, the
acknowledgements, or the cover letter). See
[ai-disclosure.md](../venues/ai-disclosure.md) for the per-venue policy matrix.
Do not treat "reducing AI traces" as a substitute for required disclosure.

## Graded mode (`--tier`) and D1-D5 dimensions

`--tier {light|medium|heavy}` is **opt-in**. Without it, the default output is exactly as before. When present, it:

- **scales thresholds** — `light` flags fewer items (looser caps), `heavy` flags more (stricter caps); `medium` keeps the current thresholds;
- **enables the D1 sentence-length check** — flags sections whose sentence-length coefficient of variation is suspiciously low (machine-even cadence);
- **labels every finding with its AIGC dimension** D1-D5 and attaches a one-line teaching note (why detectors flag the pattern).

```bash
uv run python -B scripts/deai_check.py main.tex --analyze --tier heavy
```

The five dimensions are readability-oriented, **not** tuned to evade any specific detector: D1 sentence-length variety, D2 paragraph structure, D3 information density, D4 connector frequency, D5 term-context matching. Thresholds (including `sentence_length.cv_threshold`) remain overridable via `references/deai/tone-thresholds.yaml`.
